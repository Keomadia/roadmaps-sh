# GitHub Activity CLI

Sample solution for the [github-user-activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) challenge from [Roadmap.sh User Activity](https://roadmap.sh)

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application to fetch and display the **recent activity** of a GitHub user.

With this tool, you can:
- Provide a GitHub username.
- Fetch the user's recent public activity (pushes, stars, issues, forks, etc.).
- Display the activity cleanly in the terminal.
- View the first few activities immediately, and press Enter to reveal more.

## Features

- **Fetch Recent GitHub Events**: Retrieve a user's public activities (push events, issues, stars, forks, etc.).
- **CLI Argument**: Pass the GitHub username as a command-line argument.
- **Pagination**: Display the first 3 events, then show "..." and wait for the user to press Enter to continue.
- **Clean Output**: Nicely formatted activities for easy reading.
- **Pure Python**: No external libraries needed (uses built-in `urllib` and `json`).
